This assignment is a live website that is hosted on GitHub Pages
and can be viewed on an internet browser at the following link:

https://xalvandor.github.io/CS601_HW2_Gavlishin/

If for whatever reason it is not working, please use your local host.
The JSON should still be able to be fetched using
the link stored in the app.js file.

The JSON, HTML, and CSS have been validated, though the CSS has some warnings
from the boilerplate code from the IDE.

Overall, I believe I have completed the requirements for this assignment.
Some points that I would have liked to expand upon are clearing the teams to restart the quiz,
randomizing the order of the teams, and providing some feedback after dropping.
